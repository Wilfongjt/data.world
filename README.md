# data.world
The idea is a sharable staging area for wrangling data before transfer to an open data portal (e.g., https://data.world).  The repo stores raw data and wrangling scripts.  Citizen Lab members can push raw data into the repo and authorized members can write scripts to prepare data for transfer to an open data portal.
